# Broksrekenen

Broksrekenen was a simple calculation game, originally developed by Peter Broks for the Philips P2000T home computer, which was a very popular home computer in the Netherlands back in the 1980s.
It has now been rewritten by Jeroen Broks in order to test the functionality of the Scyndi programming language, and been released under the terms of the GNU GPL.
An additional note must be made, as the GNU GPL normally affects source and binaries, but as Scyndi is only a translator based language it does not generate binaries (or at least not without the help of third party software), but I need to note that the GPL does in this case also affect the code generated by Scyndi as a result of making it process this code!

The Scyndi project can be found [here](https://github.com/Wendicka/Scyndi).
This program has most of all been released under the terms of the GPL, so you can get a bit of an idea how the Scyndi language works in its basics. 
Also note that this program was written when Scyndi itself was also still a WIP and no beta releases were there, simply because not all features Scyndi has to support were there at the time. This being said it is pretty likely some parts of this program could be done in a more efficient manner at the later stage of production of Scyndi, but for now I just wanted to test if Scyndi could handle a simple calculation game a BroksRekenen. It has been tested with a Lua translation, and that appears to work. As soon as other (more complex) targets are there, I will test them with this game too ;)
